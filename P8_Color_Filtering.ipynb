    "In this OpenCV with Python tutorial, we're going to cover how to create a sort of filter, revisiting the bitwise operations, where we will filter for specifically a certain color, attempting to just show it. Alternatively, you could also specifically filter out a specific color, and then replace it with a scene, like we did with replacing a ROI (region of image) with something else, much like how a green screen works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to filter like this you have a few options. Generally, you are probably going to convert your colors to HSV, which is \"Hue Saturation Value.\" This can help you actually pinpoint a more specific color, based on hue and saturation ranges, with a variance of value, for example. If you wanted, you could actually produce filters based on BGR values, but this would be a bit more difficult. If you're having a hard time visualizing HSV, don't feel silly, check out the Wikipedia page on HSV, there is a very useful graphic there for you to visualize it. Hue for color, saturation for the strength of the color, and value for light is how I would best describe it personally. Now let's hop in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the main code, however, we have first that we convert the frames to HSV. Nothing too special there. Next, we specify some HSV values for the color red. We create a mask, which uses an \"inRange\" statement, for our specific range. This is true or false, black or white. Next, we \"restore\" our red-ness by running a bitwise operation. Basically, we show color where there is the frame AND the mask. The white part of the mask will be red range, that was converted to pure white, while everything else became black. Finally we show it all. I chose to show the original frame, the mask, and the final result, so you can get a better idea of what is happening."
